# DiscordLinkAPI

<p>This API provides developers with the tools to create a Discord bot that can interact with a Spigot or Bukkit Minecraft server. The API utilizes the Spigot/Bukkit API, JDA 5 API, event handling, file handling, object-oriented programming, and YAML data format. The goal of the API is to simplify the process of modifying in-game and Discord events.</p>
